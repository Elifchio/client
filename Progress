# general explanation 
Task Summary: Lead Conversion Prediction Model
Objective: Build a neural network to predict customer conversion probability for leads that have successfully completed the booking call process.
Dataset:
•	30,000 leads (request-level analysis)
•	Population: Leads that completed booking calls and got sales calls scheduled (request created)
•	Target variable: CONTRACT_SIGNED
•	Conversion rate: 470/40k = 1.2% (highly imbalanced)
Sales Process Flow:
1.	Lead created (LEAD_CREATION_DATE)
2.	Booking call attempts: BC_1, BC_2, BC_3... BC_18 (with corresponding outcomes)
3.	Sales call scheduled: SC1_SCHEDULED
4.	Request created (after successful booking)
5.	Sales call appointment: SC1_APPOINTMENT
6.	Follow-up stages: IPA, installation, etc.
7.	Final outcome: CONTRACT_SIGNED (target)
Key Features Available:
•	Booking call patterns: Number of BC attempts, outcomes (NOTREACHED, LOST, VDTOPLAN, TOBERECALLED, NOSHOWNOTREACHED, etc.)
•	Timing data: Gaps between stages, time from lead creation to SC1
•	Engagement quality: Outcome types indicating interest level
•	Show-up behavior: No-show patterns vs successful contacts
Approach: Start with thorough data preparation and feature engineering before model architecture, focusing on extracting meaningful patterns from the booking call attempts and timing behaviors that predict post-sales-call conversion.

🤖 Model Implementation
Class Imbalance Handling

Method Used: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)

Why SMOTE: Best for very low conversion rates, creates realistic synthetic examples

Neural Network Architecture

F1-Score: 0.084 (best balance)

💡 Key Business Insights
Top Predictive Features

sc1_to_conversion_days (0.348 correlation) - Time kills deals
last_bc_outcome_encoded (0.123) - How booking calls end matters
showed_up_sc1 (0.096) - Attendance predicts conversion
engagement_score (0.081) - Your composite metric works

Critical Patterns Discovered

Converters convert fast: 4.08 days average vs 0.00 for non-converters
Show-up rate: Converters 53% vs non-converters 20% (2.6x difference)

# obervation
during feature enineerin it was necessary to put attention ot to create data leakage (i.e sc1 to conversion)

Lead Conversion Model - Chat Summary
🔍 Problem Identified
Data Leakage Discovery: Found that sc1_to_conversion_days feature was using future information (conversion dates) that wouldn't be available at prediction time. This was creating artificially high performance.
🛠️ Model Refinement Process
Step 1: Removed Leaky Feature

Eliminated sc1_to_conversion_days
Result: ROC-AUC dropped from 0.81 to 0.809 (minimal impact - proved model was mostly legitimate)

Step 2: Strategic Pivot to Early-Stage Model

Key Insight: Predicting conversion after sales call attendance is less valuable than predicting it earlier
Decision: Remove ALL sales call (SC) and follow-up (FU) related features
Focus on booking call data only for earlier intervention

Step 3: Early-Stage Model Results

ROC-AUC: 0.814 (actually improved!)
Accuracy: 69% (acceptable drop)
Business Impact at 0.4 threshold:

Call 2,562 leads instead of 7,674 (33% of total)
Catch 82.7% of converters (81 out of 98)
3.0x efficiency gain



🎯 Final Model Characteristics
Features Used: Only booking call data (BC_1 through BC_18 outcomes, dates)

No sales call attendance info
No future conversion dates
Clean, production-ready features

Key Predictive Features:

last_bc_outcome_encoded
engagement_score
outcome_trend
total_bc_attempts
Booking call behavioral patterns

💼 Business Value
Deployment Strategy: Early-stage scoring right after booking calls complete

Timing: Score leads immediately after BC completion
Implementation: Ready for Airflow pipeline integration
ROI: 3x more efficient lead prioritization

Recommendation: Use 0.4 threshold for optimal balance of recall (82.7%) and efficiency (3.0x gain).
🚀 Status
Production-ready model with legitimate predictive power and clear business impact. No data leakage, actionable timing, ready for automated deployment.

# observation: 
Business Recommendation:
Score leads after their 2nd or 3rd booking call attempt - this gives you:

Enough data for reliable predictions
Still early enough for intervention
Good balance of timing and accuracy

Airflow Implementation:
Trigger scoring when total_bc_attempts >= 2 rather than on a fixed schedule. This ensures you always have sufficient data for meaningful predictions.
